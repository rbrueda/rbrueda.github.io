						<h2>I have always enjoyed crafting and colouring for most of my life. I have started crafting at the age of eight. Though I discovered my passion for art at the age of eleven. I started with realism and improved dramatically from the ages of 11-14 years old. I started drawing more often when I practiced in eighth grade at recess bringing my sketchbook every day to school. Currently, I am in an art class in high school where it gives me a chance to practice my artwork while still having a handful of homework.</h1>

						<h2>Realism</h2>
						<p>
							As I started getting serious in the art world, I first tried getting used to techniques like highlighting, cross-hatching, and many more. It has only been three years but results came drastically.
	
							Though I still do not have the hyper-realism down yet, there are still many years to come where I will improve and get to that level. Using my realism skills, I started to realize my passion for using oil pastels.  
	
	
							
						</p>
						<h2>Combining Techniques to My Own Art Style</h2>
						<p>
							I have started the process of my own style at the age of 13. I have first used several references and cut it down until I have noticed my true art style. From this, it made me realize that I was good at drawing headshots because I tend to like focusing on facial expression within that particular art piece. Then I noticed that semi-realism was my most used style by using realism techniques. I am also trying to get into surrealism (though I am not great at it).
							
	
						
						</p>
						<h2>Digital Artwork</h2>
						<p>
							Different from traditional artwork, I have only started digital artwork for a couple of months, which was at the age of 13. 
							I have been using a digital art program named Krita where I did not know how to blend, as well as tend to have rough lines. Since over the last few months I have been getting used to using Krita, I learned how to blend and make smooth lines.
	
							
						</p>
						<h2>Selling/Adverising My Art</h2>
						<p>
							Like many artists at the beginning of their art journey, I had difficulty selling my art. At the age of twelve, I decided to create an Instagram art account called “creativerocio”. Though months later I started to feel unsatisfied with the account so I decided to delete it. After a year of not having an art Instagram account, on May 20, 2018, I decided to come back to the art world. Still feeling like there will be no hope in selling art, I thought to expose artwork from social media will get me one step forward then two steps back. Unfortunately, to this day (2019) I have not sold a single artwork. Though, I am trying to get into commissions, (which you will possibly see soon) to promote and get money off my art. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
						</p>
						<p>							Overall, art is one of my passions which I will continue to improve. There are definitely many ways I can improve my art, though I am taking it one step at a time. I will continue to push myself in my artwork not just to make me a better artist, but because it brings me and a lot of people happy. :)
